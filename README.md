### Notes

I'd like to thank Wooza for this opportunity to face this challenge, my programming background was not easy because I risked everything to become a programmer. Now I see I'm improving a lot, so, even if I do not be chosen by you, I really appreciated the test, it has blown my mind working with redux, such a tool I was learning before. I'd like to thank Mariana Barata for being a receptive person through my recruitment in here. That's all guys, hope you enjoy! :)
